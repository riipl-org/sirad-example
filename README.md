# rpe-example

Worked example of using the RIIPL Processing Engine - rpe - to
process raw data files.

*Note*: data generated by `make_data.py` uses the [Faker](https://github.com/joke2k/faker) to create synthetic data that is realistic but does not represent actual individuals. Any data that looks personally identifiable is not.

* Requires Python 3.6 or later.
* Install dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`


## build
This project uses Scons to work an end-to-end example of deidentifying research data using `rpe`.

To build:

`$ scons`

This is a work in progress. More details to come.
