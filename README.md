# rpe-example

Worked example of using the RIIPL Processing Engine - rpe - to
process raw data files.

*Note*: data generated by `make_data.py` uses the [Faker](https://github.com/joke2k/faker) to create synthetic data that is realistic but does not represent actual individuals. Any data that looks personally identifiable is not.

* Requires Python 3.6 or later.
* Install dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`


## build
This project uses Scons to work an end-to-end example of deidentifying research data using `rpe`.

To build:

`$ scons`

## overview

`rpe` is framework for deidentifying and integrating research information.

After the build finishes, an sqlite database called `research_v1` will be created in the `build` directory.

This database has two tables created from synthetic data.

### tax

RPE_ID | RECORD_ID | SSN | JOB | BIRTH_DATE | FILE_DATE | ADJUSTED_GROSS_INCOME | IMPORT_DT
-------|-----------|-----|-----|------------|-----------|-----------------------|----------

### credit_scores

RPE_ID | RECORD_ID | BIRTH_DATE | CREDIT_SCORE | IMPORT_DT
-------|-----------|------------|--------------|----------

* The RPE_ID is an anoymous identifier created from the raw data file. It can be used to join the two tables.
* RECORD_ID uniquely identifiers the reccord.
* All personally identifiable information has been removed.
